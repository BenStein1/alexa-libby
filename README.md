This is a skill built for Amazon's Alexa service that tells you about your
[Couch Potato](https://couchpota.to), [Sickbeard](http://sickbeard.com),
[Sonarr](https://sonarr.tv), or [Radarr](http://radarr.video) queue. It allows you to ask Alexa the
following:

> Alexa, ask Libby to add the movie The Godfather
>
> Alexa, ask Libby to add the movie The Godfather released in 1974
>
> Alexa, ask Libby if the film The Dark Knight is on the list
>
> Alexa, ask Libby if the film Batman 1989 is on the list
>
> Alexa, ask Libby to add the show Silicon Valley
>
> Alexa, ask Libby if the series Jessica Jones is on the list

If you're just getting started developing skills for Alexa, I'd recommend reading [Getting Started
with the Alexa Skills
Kit](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/getting-started-guide) and
[Developing an Alexa Skill as a Lambda
Function](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/developing-an-alexa-skill-as-a-lambda-function) to get familiar with the process.

You can download a [pre-packaged version of the
app](https://github.com/josephschmitt/alexa-libby/releases/latest/) if you don't want to run
from source..

## Configuring The Skill

Open the [`config/default.json`](../master/config/default.json) file and fill in the right values
for your server configuration. There are 3 sections to the `alexa-libby` config:

1. `"server"`: This contains basic information about your server. Inside this config are keys for
`"hostname"` and `"port"`. If you set these values here, they will be inherited by configurations
for movies and shows. If your providers need different values, you can set them individually in
their `"server"` sections and they'll override these values.
2. `"movies"`: This contains information about what service you use to track movies. The `"provider"`
field tells  Libby  what service you use to track movies. Valid values are `"couchpotato"` and
`"radarr"`. Most  importantly, you should fill in the `"apiKey"` field from your service, and a
`"urlBase"` if you use one (you'd know if you did).
3. `"shows"`: Same as movies, but for shows. Valid `"provider"` field values are `"sickbeard"` and
`"sonarr"`. Make sure you fill in the `"apiKey"` and `"urlBase"` if you have one set.

If you don't use a provider (for example you only track tv shows and not movies), make sure to
delete that entire section of the config, otherwise you'll get an error.

If you don't want to accidentally commit your configuration, then make a duplicate of the
`default.json` file and call it `local.json`. It will override any configuration from default and
is ignored by git.

Here are some sample configs for some common setups:

### Radarr and Sonarr on the same hostname, but different ports

```
{
  "alexa-libby": {
    "server": {
      "hostname": "http://my-pvr-server.com"
    },
    "movies": {
      "provider": "radarr",
      "server": {
        "apiKey": "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456",
        "port": 7878
      }
    },
    "shows": {
      "provider": "sonarr",
      "server": {
        "apiKey": "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456",
        "port": 8989
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Radarr and Sonarr on different hostnames altogether

```
{
  "alexa-libby": {
    "server": {},
    "movies": {
      "provider": "radarr",
      "server": {
        "apiKey": "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456",
        "hostname": "http://my-pvr-server.com",
        "port": 7878
      }
    },
    "shows": {
      "provider": "sonarr",
      "server": {
        "apiKey": "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456",
        "hostname": "http://my-pvr-server.com",
        "port": 8989
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Radarr and Sonarr with a `urlBase` set on a common hostname

The `urlBase` is used when your provider isn't at the server root, but at a subdirectory, like:
`http://my-pvr-server.com/sonarr`.

```
{
  "alexa-libby": {
    "server": {
      "hostname": "http://my-pvr-server.com"
    },
    "movies": {
      "provider": "radarr",
      "server": {
        "apiKey": "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456",
        "urlBase": "radarr"
      }
    },
    "shows": {
      "provider": "sonarr",
      "server": {
        "apiKey": "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456",
        "urlBase": "sonarr"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Creating a Lambda function

The skill is built to be easily hosted on Amazon's [AWS Lambda
service](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/). You'll need to create an Amazon AWS account, and then head
over to the [Lambda Dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home). Once there, click
"Create a Lambda function", and provide the following settings:

1. **Select blueprint**: Click on _Blank Function_.
2. **Configure triggers**: This one can be easy to miss. You should see a dotted out rounded square
to the left of the Lambda logo. Click on it and from the dropdown, choose _Alexa Skills Kit_.
3. **Configure function**:
  - Name: `alexa-libby`. Honestly this can be whatever you want, but if you want to use the
    deploy function later, it's best to use the same name as the project here.
  - Description: Doesn't matter. Feel free to copy the project description.
  - Runtime: _Node.js 6.10_. You can choose the older version if you want, but if you do make
    sure to update the `.babelrc` file to tell babel to target the older verison of Node. If you
    don't know what that means, just go with 6.10.
  - Code entry type: _Upload a .ZIP file_. ([You can grab the pre-built zip](https://github.com/josephschmitt/alexa-libby/releases/latest) and customize the config, or read
    on below for instructions on generating a ZIP from source)
  - Lambda function handler and role: Under **Existing role** choose `lambda_basic_execution`.

Click Create lambda function and you're done. After you've created your Lambda function, look at the
top right of the page to get your Lambda ARN number. You'll need this in the next step, so either
write that number down, or keep this page open.

It should be noted that as of right now, Alexa Skills only work with Lambda functions deployed to
US East-1 (N. Virginia) and EU (Ireland). Additionally, the `AMAZON.Movie` and `AMAZON.TVSeries`
built-in intent slots this project is currently using are in beta, and only working in the US at the
moment. So for now, choosing US East-1 is the safest way to make sure it all works. If you do want
to try and get it working in the EU region, you'll have to change the slot types to
`AMAZON.Literal`, and provide your own samples using the models
[dictionary](../master/models/dictionary.js) to generate new interaction models that include those
samples. You can read more about doing this over at the
[alexa-utterances](https://github.com/alexa-js/alexa-utterances) project.

## Deploying the Skill

If you don't care about the nitty-gritty of NodeJS projects, you can just download the
`alexa-libby.zip` file from the [latest
release](https://github.com/josephschmitt/alexa-libby/releases/latest/), update the
`config/default.json` file with your server settings, re-zip, and upload to lambda.

If you want more control, or to make your own updates to the project, check out the master branch
and then do an `npm install` at the project root. Once all the dependencies are installed you have 2
options:

### Manually package and upload

Run `npm run package`, which will create an `alexa-libby.zip` file in your project  directory.
Back in the Lambda dashboard, look to see where it says "Upload" next to "Function package". Click
upload, choose the zip file, and click save.

### Deploy from the command line

You can also use [node-lambda](https://github.com/motdotla/node-lambda) to deploy to your Lambda
function directly from the command line. After running `npm install`, a `.env` file was created in
the root of the project. Open the `.env` file and enter the 3 missing pieces of information
necessary for deployment:

1. Your AWS Access Key Id
2. Your AWS Secret Access Key
3. The role used to execute the function. This will be in the format of
  `arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/ROLENAME`

You canm get an access key id and secret by creating a new user in the
[IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home). Make sure you enable the "Programmatic
access" access type. For the role, just click on the Roles tab, choose a role, and copy its ARN.
Make sure your user has access to create lambda functions. Unless you're an AWS IAM wizard, choosing
the `AWSLambdaFullAccess` should work.

Finally, run `npm run deploy` and if you set everything up correctly, it should finish successfully
and you'll now have a function on lambda called `alexa-libby`. If this is the first time you've
created this function, you'll also have to make sure to go to the lambda console, edit your
function, click on "Triggers", and set "Alexa Skills Kit" as your trigger. If you're just updating
an existing function, then you're fine. Please visit the
[node-lambda](https://github.com/motdotla/node-lambda) project page for more information on
deploying from the command line.

## Setting up the Skill

To set up the skill, head on over to [Alexa skills kit
development console](https://developer.amazon.com/edw/home.html) and add a new skill by following
these steps:

1. **Skill Information**: Fill in the basic skill information however you choose. If you're feeling
uncreative, you can put `alexa-libby` for the name, and `libby` for the _Invocation
Name_.
2. **Interaction Model**: There are two ways to do this. The first way is to use the new Skill
Builder. Once you have it loaded, click on Code Editor, click on the area titled "Drag and drop your
.json file", and choose the `interaction_model/skill_builder.json` file. Click Save Model, then
Build Model. If for some reason the Skill Builder beta doesn't work, then you can try it the old
way. In the Intent Schema field, copy the contents of the `interaction_model/intent_schema.json`
file and paste them in. Then in the Sample Utterances field, copy the contents of
`interaction_model/sample_utterances.txt` and paste those in. Make sure to Save your changes.
3. **Configuration**: Set the Service Endpoint Type to AWS Lambda ARN, and choose your region. Now
comes the time to grab the ARN from the previous step that you hopefully either wrote down or kept
open in a different tab or browser window.
4. **Test**: Make sure the toggle at the top is Enabled. You should now be able to test to make sure
everything's working. Scroll down to the Service Simulator and in the Enter Utterance field, try
asking Libby one of the phrases from up top, like "is The Dark Knight on the list". If everything's
working correctly, you should see data get filled in on both the Request and Response boxes. If you
do, then you're pretty much done and all set.
5. **Publishing Information**: This isn't necessary, but it helps the skill look nice in your Alexa
app. You can fill in as much of the metadata as you like, but the one I'd really recommend is
uploading an icon. An icon is included in this project and should work well for the 108x108 small
icon slot.

And that's it, all done.

## Testing The Skill Locally

You can use [node-lambda](https://github.com/motdotla/node-lambda) to test this skill locally. In
the `test_events` directory are several event files you can use for testing, and they should map
pretty well to each Intent. To test an intent, simply update the `EVENT_FILE` value in your `.env`
config file to point to the event to test against. Make sure you run `npm install` from the command
line to get the the latest npm packages, and then run `npm start`.
